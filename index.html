  <h1>Portfolio</h1>
  <p>People often comment on how normal Mr. Buffett is, and I'm inclined to agree. I expected that he would walk into the room and all the air would rush past him like a breached airlock, but instead it took everyone a minute to realize that he had even arrived. He was dressed formally but not overly so, and was friendly with the students who asked him questions. At the end, he took group photos with the students from every school and shook each of our hands. If I didn't know his face, I wouldn't think twice if he were buying a case of Charles Shaw from me at Trader Joe's.</p>
